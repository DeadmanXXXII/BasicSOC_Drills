Basic-SOCDrills Instructions
For Analysts Working in a Remote SOC
Introduction
Welcome to the Basic-SOCDrills tool. 
This script is designed to automate various security operations center (SOC) tasks, helping you manage security drills, perform system checks, and handle incident responses. 
This guide will help you set up the tool on a Kali Linux system, integrate it with essential security tools, and configure it for various environments such as Linux, Windows, AWS, Azure, and GCP.

1. Prerequisites
Before setting up the Basic-SOCDrills tool, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1.1. Install Python and GTK Development Libraries
The Basic-SOCDrills tool is written in Python and uses GTK for the graphical user interface. Install Python 3 and the GTK development libraries:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-gi libgtk-3-dev
1.2. Install Essential Security Tools
The tool relies on several security tools. Install them with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y clamav nmap macchanger logrotate suricata lynis
Here's a brief overview of each tool's purpose:

ClamAV: Open-source antivirus engine.
Nmap: Network scanning and vulnerability detection tool.
Macchanger: Tool for changing MAC addresses.
Logrotate: Tool for managing log files.
Suricata: IDS/IPS for intrusion detection and prevention.
Lynis: Security auditing tool for Unix-based systems.
2. Configure Security Tools
2.1. Configure ClamAV
Update ClamAV virus definitions to ensure you have the latest updates:

bash
Copy code
sudo freshclam
2.2. Configure Suricata
Copy the default Suricata configuration file and update it as needed:

bash
Copy code
sudo cp /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml.bak
sudo suricata-update
Edit the /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml file to match your network environment:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
Adjust the configuration for network interfaces, rules, and logging based on your requirements.

2.3. Configure Logrotate
Ensure that logrotate is configured to manage logs for ClamAV, Suricata, and other SOC tools:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf
Add or update configurations for log management as needed.

3. Save and Prepare the SOC Tool Script
3.1. Save the SOC Tool Script
Create a new file named soc_tool.py and paste the provided SOC tool script into it:

bash
Copy code
nano soc_tool.py
Paste the script content and save the file.

3.2. Make the Script Executable
Change the permissions to make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x soc_tool.py
4. Add Dependencies to requirements.txt
Create a requirements.txt file to manage the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
nano requirements.txt
Add the following content:

plaintext
Copy code
# requirements.txt

# GTK+ 3.0 bindings for Python
python3-gi
Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-gi
5. Build and Run the Project
Since this is a Python script, you donâ€™t need to build it. Instead, you can run it directly:

bash
Copy code
./soc_tool.py
If you encounter permission issues, you might need to run the script with sudo:

bash
Copy code
sudo ./soc_tool.py
6. Verify Functionality
Ensure the tool performs the following tasks:

Change MAC Address: Check the change_mac_address() function.
Clear Caches: Check the clear_caches() function.
Update Antivirus: Ensure update_antivirus() updates ClamAV.
Search Vulnerabilities: Test search_vulnerabilities(target) with a valid target.
Intrusion Detection: Verify intrusion_detection() by checking Suricata logs.
Check Uploads: Implement and test check_uploads().
Log Management: Verify log_management() by checking log files.
Threat Intelligence: Check threat_intelligence_integration() for data integration.
Incident Response: Test incident_response_automation() for response actions.
Security Event Correlation: Implement and test security_event_correlation().
User Behavior Analytics: Implement user_behavior_analytics() for analysis.
Backup and Recovery: Verify backup_and_recovery() for backup tasks.
Compliance Monitoring: Check compliance_monitoring() for compliance checks.
Security Awareness Training: Verify security_awareness_training() with the HTML file.
7. Customization and Extensions
You can extend the script for additional features and integrations:

Integrate md5house and crackstation for Password Cracking:

Use APIs or command-line tools for hash analysis and password cracking.
Integrate Exploit Databases and Dark Web Intelligence:

Fetch data from Exploit-DB and Dark Web Intelligence using their APIs or scrapers.
Integrate with AWS, Azure, GCP:

Use CLI tools or APIs for these cloud platforms:
AWS CLI: aws configure
Azure CLI: az login
GCP CLI: gcloud init
8. Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues you might encounter and their solutions:

8.1. Permissions
Some operations require elevated privileges:

bash
Copy code
sudo ./soc_tool.py
8.2. Missing Dependencies
Ensure all necessary packages are installed:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-gi libgtk-3-dev clamav nmap macchanger logrotate suricata lynis
8.3. Configuration Files
Verify the configurations for ClamAV, Suricata, and other tools.

9. Example Use Cases
Here are some example commands and functions:

Change MAC Address:

python
Copy code
change_mac_address()
Update Antivirus Definitions:

python
Copy code
update_antivirus()
Perform a Vulnerability Scan:

python
Copy code
search_vulnerabilities('192.168.1.1')
Intrusion Detection with Suricata:

python
Copy code
intrusion_detection()
